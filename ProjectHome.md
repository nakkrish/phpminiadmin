**phpminiadmin** - Lightweight alternative to heavy phpMyAdmin for easy access MySQL databases.

It's extremely small (just ~30Kb) standalone php script that can be used by web developers or site owners to quickly access MySQL databases of their web sites.

Instead of installing huge phpMyAdmin (~11Mb) and trying to figure out how to configure it, you upload just one file and it's ready to use!
  * Just access it via the browser (ex. `http://yoursite.com/phpminiadmin.php`) and script will ask you for necessary info (db login/pwd, etc...).
  * After successfull db login you will see area where you able to enter any SQL commands (select, update, insert, etc.)
  * If you don't know SQL it's still easy to see list of tables in DB, export and import data/structure using 'quick links' on the top bar (see [screenshots](http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=181023)).

And due to it's simplicity script really fast and need just a little server resources! (your hosting provider will be glad ;)

Dual licensed: GPL + MIT, so feel free to integrate phpMiniAdmin in any your projects.
